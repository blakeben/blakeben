        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a junior in college with a passion for computer science, I am committed to pursuing a career in this field. With a solid
foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, I have developed strong problem-solving and critical
thinking skills. I am a self-motivated learner who is always eager to expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving world of
technology. My experience in various coding projects has honed my ability to work collaboratively with others while also being
an effective individual contributor. I have also developed a keen eye for detail and a commitment to producing high-quality
work that meets project specifications. In addition to my technical skills, I have strong communication and interpersonal skills,
making me an effective team player and leader. I am always open to feedback and willing to adapt my approach to achieve the
best results.</p>
